[00:00] Cloud Computing. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will be discussing a very important and widely used concept in modern technology, which is cloud computing. Over the next few minutes, I want to walk you through the meaning of cloud computing, why it matters, its key features, its service models, its deployment models, advantages, challenges, and real-world applications. By the end of this lecture, you should have a clear understanding of why cloud computing has become such a big part of our digital world.

[00:58] Let's start with a simple definition. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and even artificial intelligence. Instead of owning physical hardware and managing everything locally, individuals and organizations can access computing resources on demand from cloud service providers. In other words, the cloud is a way of renting computing resources instead of buying and maintaining them yourself. To understand cloud computing more clearly, imagine how we use electricity. When you switch on a light bulb, you don't own the power plant. You simply pay for the electricity you consume. Similarly, with cloud computing, you pay for the computing power, storage, and services you actually use, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This model makes technology more affordable, scalable, and convenient.

[01:59] Now, let's explore the key characteristics of cloud computing. First, it offers on-demand self-service. This means users can access computing resources whenever they need them without requiring human interaction with the provider. Second, it provides broad network access. Cloud services are available over the internet and can be accessed from different devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Third, it features resource pooling. Service providers share resources across multiple customers while still keeping data isolated and secure. Fourth, there is rapid elasticity. Resources can scale up or down quickly depending on demand. Finally, cloud computing has measured service. This means usage is monitored and billed according to the resources consumed, similar to how utilities like water and electricity are charged.

[02:59] Now, let's move to the service models of cloud computing. There are three major ones. The first is Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS. In this model, the provider delivers fundamental computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users can build and manage their own applications on top of this infrastructure. A common example is Amazon Web Services EC2. The second is Platform as a Service, or PaaS. Here, the provider delivers not only infrastructure but also a development platform. Developers can use built-in tools, databases, and frameworks to create applications without worrying about managing servers. An example of this is Google App Engine. The third is Software as a Service, or SaaS. In this model, the provider delivers ready-to-use applications over the internet. Users don't have to install or maintain the software; they simply access it through a browser. Examples include Gmail, Microsoft 365, and Zoom.

[04:00] Besides service models, there are deployment models of cloud computing. The first is the public cloud. This is when services are delivered over the internet and shared by multiple organizations. It's cost-effective and scalable but may raise security concerns. The second is the private cloud. This is dedicated to a single organization and offers more control and security but can be more expensive. The third is the hybrid cloud, which combines public and private clouds to balance flexibility with security. Finally, there is the community cloud, which is shared by several organizations with common goals or requirements, such as healthcare or education institutions.

[05:00] Now, let's discuss the advantages of cloud computing. First, it reduces costs. Organizations no longer need to invest heavily in hardware, maintenance, or data centers. Second, it improves scalability. Businesses can easily expand their resources during peak times and reduce them when not needed. Third, it enhances flexibility. Employees can access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection. Fourth, it provides reliability. Leading cloud providers offer backup, disaster recovery, and high availability. Fifth, it supports innovation. Developers and businesses can experiment and deploy solutions faster without worrying about infrastructure limitations.

[06:00] However, cloud computing also has challenges. The first is security and privacy. Since data is stored in remote servers, organizations must trust providers to protect sensitive information. The second is downtime. Cloud services depend on internet connectivity, and outages can affect access to critical resources. The third is compliance. Certain industries such as healthcare and finance must follow strict regulations about where and how data is stored. The fourth is vendor lock-in. Once an organization chooses a particular cloud provider, switching to another can be difficult and costly. Finally, there are performance concerns, especially when applications require very high processing speed or low latency.

[07:00] Let's now look at real-world applications of cloud computing. One of the most common is data storage and backup. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive allow users to store and access files securely in the cloud. Another application is in business collaboration. Tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams rely on cloud infrastructure to support communication and teamwork. In entertainment, streaming platforms such as Netflix and Spotify deliver movies, music, and games through the cloud. In healthcare, cloud solutions enable electronic medical records, telemedicine, and AI-based diagnosis. In education, platforms like Coursera and Google Classroom use the cloud to deliver online courses and virtual classrooms. Even in research, cloud computing supports large-scale data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence projects.

[08:00] A growing area is cloud computing in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. Processing large amounts of data requires enormous computing power. With the cloud, organizations can rent high-performance computing resources only when needed, making AI research and data-driven decision-making more affordable. Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer machine learning services, natural language processing tools, and advanced analytics that companies of any size can leverage. Another emerging field is edge computing, which is closely related to cloud computing. In edge computing, data is processed closer to the source, such as IoT devices, rather than in distant cloud servers. This reduces latency and supports real-time decision-making, especially in applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial automation. However, the edge still relies heavily on the cloud for storage, management, and large-scale analysis.

[09:00] Now, let's talk briefly about future trends in cloud computing. Multi-cloud strategies are becoming more popular, where organizations use services from multiple providers to avoid vendor lock-in and improve reliability. Serverless computing is another trend, where developers only focus on writing code, and the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure. Security and compliance will also continue to be a major focus, with providers investing more in encryption and advanced security technologies. Finally, integration with artificial intelligence, blockchain, and 5G will expand the possibilities of what cloud computing can achieve.

[10:00] To summarize our lecture today: cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. It has three main service models: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. It also has different deployment models such as public, private, hybrid, and community clouds. The benefits include reduced cost, flexibility, scalability, and reliability, while the challenges include security, downtime, compliance, and vendor lock-in. Cloud computing has many real-world applications in storage, collaboration, entertainment, healthcare, education, research, and artificial intelligence. Looking ahead, trends like multi-cloud, serverless computing, and edge computing will continue to shape the future of this technology. Thank you for listening. I hope this lecture gave you a clear and detailed understanding of cloud computing and its importance in todayâ€™s digital world.
